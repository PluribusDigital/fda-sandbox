      <h3>What's This All About?</h3>
      <p>
        Staff at <a href="http://stsiinc.com/" target="_blank">STSI</a> developed a prototype primarily based on openFDA data made available by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
        We noticed that there was lots of <strong><em>great data</em></strong>, with meaningful <strong><em>connections</em></strong> between data elements. 
        However, the <em>connections were not apparent or easily accessible</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prototype is all about those <strong><em>connections</em></strong>. We expose connections in two big ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Combining</strong> information about any given drug into a comprehensive detail page, including data from openFDA, but also other FDA and external sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring</strong> connections through a tree visualization tool.</li>
      </ol>
